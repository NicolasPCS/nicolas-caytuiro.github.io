  title={Symmetrization of 3D Generative Models},
  author={Nicolas Caytuiro and Ivan Sipiran},
  abstract={We propose a novel data-centric approach to promote symmetry in 3D generative models by modifying the training data rather than the model architecture. Our method begins with an analysis of reflectional symmetry in both real-world 3D shapes and samples generated by state-of-the-art models. We hypothesize that training a generative model exclusively on half-objects, obtained by reflecting one half of the shapes along the x=0 plane, enables the model to learn a rich distribution of partial geometries which, when reflected during generation, yield complete shapes that are both visually plausible and geometrically symmetric. To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models. Experiments demonstrate that the generated shapes are symmetrical and consistent, compared with the generated objects from the original model and the original dataset objects.},

  title={3D Shape Generation: A Survey},
  author={Nicolas Caytuiro and Ivan Sipiran},
  abstract={Recent advances in deep learning have significantly transformed the field of 3D shape generation, enabling the synthesis of complex, diverse, and semantically meaningful 3D objects. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in 3D shape generation, organizing the discussion around three core components: shape representations, generative modeling approaches, and evaluation protocols. We begin by categorizing 3D representations into explicit, implicit, and hybrid setups, highlighting their structural properties, advantages, and limitations. Next, we review a wide range of generation methods, focusing on feedforward architectures. We further summarize commonly used datasets and evaluation metrics that assess fidelity, diversity, and realism of generated shapes. Finally, we identify open challenges and outline future research directions that could drive progress in controllable, efficient, and high-quality 3D shape generation. This survey aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and practitioners seeking a structured and in-depth understanding of this rapidly evolving field.},

  abstract={The primary objective of this study is to develop a cryptographic algorithm that integrates the Caesar and Vernam encryption methods, further secured through key encryption using a Hash function, aimed at enhancing message security in communication channels like WhatsApp ChatBot. The methodology involved designing and implementing the algorithm within a WhatsApp ChatBot to encrypt and decrypt messages directly within the platform, thereby demonstrating its practicality in real-world applications. Comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance against other cryptographic methods, revealing a substantial improvement in data security. Specifically, the proposed approach showed superior resistance to unauthorized access and cryptographic attacks, outperforming methods such as ROT13 combined with Vernam and Stream Cipher, or modified Caesar techniques. The results also confirmed the algorithm’s capacity to protect message integrity and confidentiality effectively, addressing the challenges of secure digital communication. In conclusion, the findings validate the potential of the proposed algorithm as a robust solution for safeguarding data in messaging platforms. However, to fully explore its scalability and practical deployment, further research involving detailed simulations, real-world testing, and applicability in broader information security contexts is recommended. This underscores the importance of continuous innovation in cryptographic methods to enhance digital security and protect sensitive communications on platforms like WhatsApp.},

  abstract={Fostering prosocial behaviors in students is not only beneficial for their emotional well-being and personal growth but also contributes to a positive school environment and the formation of responsible citizens. The objective of the research is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Sandbox video game Minecraft in promoting prosocial behaviors in students of Regular Basic Education. An experimental methodology was employed, applying the game to the students and administering a pretest and posttest based on the “Prosocial Skills Scale for Adolescents” (PSS-A), which measures solidarity, helping response, perspective, altruism, and assistance. Five personalized multiplayer gaming sessions were conducted. The results indicate that the game dynamics implemented over the five sessions significantly improved solidarity, helping response, perspective, altruism, and assistance among the students. A positive short-term influence on prosocial behavior was evident. The study suggests that the use of the Sandbox video game Minecraft can have a significant impact on fostering prosocial behaviors in students. These findings highlight the potential of video games as an educational tool to enhance social skills and responsible citizenship in the current school context. The research demonstrates that the use of video games like Minecraft in a Sandbox approach can effectively improve prosocial behavior in students of Regular Basic Education. However, the need for future research to examine the long-term durability of these effects and consider the integration of video games into educational programs more broadly and strategically is emphasized.},

  title={Annotated Peruvian Banknote Dataset for currency recognition and classification},
  author={Nicolas Caytuiro and Jackeline Melady Peña-Alejandro and Eveling Gloria Castro-Gutierrez and Jose Sulla-Torres and Benjamin Maraza-Quispe},
  abstract={The real-time detection of multinational banknotes remains an ongoing research challenge within the academic community. Numerous studies have been conducted to address the need for rapid and accurate banknote recognition, counterfeit detection, and identification of damaged banknotes. State-of-the-art techniques, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), have supplanted traditional digital image processing methods in banknote recognition and classification. However, the success of ML or DL projects critically hinges on the size and comprehensiveness of the datasets employed. Existing datasets suffer from several limitations. Firstly, there is a notable absence of a Peruvian banknote dataset suitable for training ML or DL models. Second, the lack of annotated data with specific labels and metadata for Peruvian currency hinders the development of effective supervised learning models for banknote recognition and classification. Lastly, datasets from different regions may not align with the unique characteristics, design, and security features of Peruvian banknotes, limiting the accuracy and applicability of models in a Peruvian context. To address these limitations, we have meticulously curated a comprehensive dataset comprising a total of 9,315 images of Peruvian banknotes, encompassing both old and new denominations from 2011 (old) and 2019 (new). The Peruvian banknote dataset includes denominations of 10, 20, 50, and 100 Peruvian soles. Importantly, as indicated by, both the 2011 and 2019 families of banknotes are currently in circulation, further enhancing the dataset's relevance for real-world applications in currency recognition and verification.
This dataset serves as a vital resource for addressing the challenges in real-time multinational banknote detection. By offering a comprehensive collection of images of Peruvian banknotes, both old and new, this dataset fills a critical gap in the field of banknote recognition. Researchers can utilize it to train and evaluate advanced machine learning and deep learning models, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of banknote processing systems.},

  abstract={This research aims to determine how the use of Augmented Reality technology propiciates learning achievements through generate emotions in students. The metodology used for development of this research was the selection and application of ARToolKit open-source software, specialized in augmented reality implementation, after that, we implemented a 3D model on the topic “Cell Biology” developed in “Unity3D”. A Likert scale test according to main emotions is applied to a sample of 50 students selected through simple random sampling from a total population of 100 students. The sample is divided into two groups, 25 students for the experimental group and 25 students for the control group. In experimental group, Augmented Reality will be used during three learning sessions. In control group Augmented Reality is not used. In both cases the Likert scale test will be applied after each learning session. At the end of the three learning sessions, a competency-based evaluation is applied according to selected criteria. The results show that 80% of the 25 students in the experimental group improved their academic performance with respect to the control group, which maintained a standard average academic performance of 50%. In conclusion, we can say that the use of Augmented Reality technology in the development of sessions in teaching-learning process, generate emotions in students who are enable to improve their learnings.},

  abstract={The need to analyze student interactions in virtual learning environments (VLE) and the improvements this generates is an increasingly emerging reality in order to make timely predictions and optimize student learning. This research aims to implement a proposal of standardized learning behavior indicators in virtual learning environments (VLE) to design and implement efficient and timely learning analytics (LA) processes. The methodology consisted of a data management analysis that was carried out in the Moodle platform of the Faculty of Education Sciences of the National University of San Agustin of Arequipa, with the participation of 20 teachers, where qualitative online questionnaires were used to collect the participants' perceptions. The results propose a standard in terms of indicators of behavior in the teaching-learning process in EVA as they are: Preparation for learning, progress in the progress of the course, resources for learning, interaction in the forums and evaluation of resources. These were evaluated through learning analytics and show the efficiency of the proposed indicators. The conclusions highlight the importance of implementing standardized behavior indicators that allow us to efficiently develop learning analytics processes in VLE in order to obtain better predictions to make timely decisions and optimize the teaching-learning processes.},

A collaborative experience was developed with 25 students in an asynchronous e-learning environment. The activities consisted of forum discussions, chat and project development in a wiki environment. The research method includes a quantitative analysis whose forum rating was developed by applying a rubric. The use of didactic strategies such as Wikis, Forums and Chat in the learning sessions promotes collaborative learning where the main factors for this to happen are the degree of appropriation of these technologies by students and the mastery of their use by teachers. It is not possible to affirm the superiority of one tool over another because each has its own characteristics and could be used for different purposes, besides having complementary functions, they must organize and complement each other to develop collaborative learning.},

  abstract={The constant evolution of emerging technologies in the midst of the digital era highlights the need to replace traditional methods of student attendance registration in universities. Often, students record their attendance at the beginning of classes. This method can divert students' attention during class, and the time it takes for the teacher to record attendance increases significantly [1], considering the number of students enrolled in certain subjects. In this context, this research proposes the development of a mobile application for the Android operating system for attendance registration and control for students at the Universidad Católica de Santa María (UCSM) using the XP (Extreme Programming) project management methodology. The phases of XP detail the entire process for the development of the application and its launch, with Firebase as the Database Manager. To conduct the respective tests of the application, tests were carried out on fourth-year students of Systems Engineering, belonging to the Faculty of Physical and Formal Sciences and Engineering at UCSM. The attendance system was connected to a database that stores information about students and their attendance records. Additionally, the user interface displays attendance records from an attractive, intuitive, and easy-to-manage perspective for both teachers and students. The research results show that the use of the application by UCSM teachers and students reduces and optimizes the time invested in the attendance registration process compared to traditional methods, according to the satisfaction and acceptance criteria of the "ASYS" application.},

  author={Nicolas Caytuiro, Eveling G. Castro-Gutierrez, and Jackeline M. Peña-Alejandro},
  abstract={Visual impairment significantly impacts the lives of millions globally, affecting daily activities and independence. Assistive technologies have emerged as promising tools to enhance autonomy and inclusion for individuals with visual disabilities. Despite numerous tools addressing mobility, navigation, orientation, and object recognition, many remain as proposals or prototypes, with limited impact on the visually impaired community. A comprehensive systematic review is crucial to assess the current state of assistive technology, IoT, and Computer Vision, identifying limitations, areas for improvement, and opportunities for new solutions. This review aims to analyze and synthesize theoretical and practical literature related to assistive tools for individuals with visual impairments. Conducting an exhaustive search on academic databases such as IEEE and Scopus, the review focuses on keywords like computer vision, deep learning, blind or visually impaired. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will guide study selection, with a focus on evaluating study quality. The systematic review analyzes recent technological advancements in assistive tools for the visually impaired, assessing limitations and contributions found in the literature. Key aspects, such as the accuracy and reliability of IoT- and Computer Vision-based assistive technologies, are thoroughly evaluated. The University Isabel I systematic review method is employed, involving a manual search of 71 articles from journals, conference proceedings, and books. The findings provide valuable insights for future research, offering a current overview of existing assistive tools for visual impairment. Limitations and improvements identified guide and inspire future research in assistive technologies, IoT, and computer vision. Results reveal a higher publication rate in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) journal from the United States. The predominant limitation is technological dependence (16.46%), while the most significant contribution lies in the accuracy of detecting objects of interest (11.70%). This systematic review aims to broaden the understanding of existing assistive tools for visual impairment, focusing on technological advancements in Computer Vision and IoT. It anticipates guiding future research towards developing more effective assistive tools for visually impaired individuals.},

This study seeks to investigate the relationship between the activities carried out by the teacher and the level of learning achieved, doing so in an automated manner. Therefore, as a first step, it is necessary to identify what the teacher does and how these actions relate to learning outcomes.
In this paper, Process Mining techniques are applied to automatically discover (model) and analyze the teaching–learning process in higher education. The results demonstrate that this approach is feasible and effective.},

  author={Benjamin Maraza-Quispe and Olga Melina Alejandro-Oviedo and Nicolas Caytuiro and Willian Alexis Barrios-Concha and Lita Marianela Quispe-Flores and Monica Milagros Jordan-Franco},
  abstract={The purpose of this research is to determine to what extent the use of 3D graphics in the educational process improves the spatial orientation skills of secondary school students. The research follows a qualitative approach of experimental type, the population is constituted by 300 students of Secondary Education of which through a simple random sampling 25 students were chosen. Four sessions of 50 minutes each have been developed, in which three-dimensional models were used, in order to determine if spatial skills are developed. A psychometric pre-test and post-test of spatial reasoning was taken in order to determine how much the spatial skills of the selected sample members are developed based on the measurement of five criteria: Construction of three-dimensional objects (intermediate level), Construction of three-dimensional objects (advanced level), Rotation of objects from references (intermediate level), Rotation of objects from references (advanced level) and deconstruction of three-dimensional objects. For the data analysis, the data from the scores obtained by the students in both the pre-test and the post-test are processed. The results allow us to visualize that the use of 3D graphics in the teaching-learning processes allows us to improve spatial orientation skills to a great extent. The result is evidenced in the increase of the total scores obtained in the post-test in comparison with the results of the pre-test. Likewise, an increase from 47.9% to 75.1% of items answered correctly was observed on average, which was corroborated with the Student's t-test that gave a P value of less than 0.05, demonstrating the reliability of the research developed and therefore significantly improving spatial orientation skills in students through the use of 3D graphics technology.},

  abstract={In recent years, new research has appeared in the area of education, which has focused on the use of information technology and the Internet to promote online learning, breaking many barriers of traditional education such as space, time, quantity and coverage.
However, we have found that these new proposals present problems such as linear access to content, patronized teaching structures, and non-flexible methods in the style of user learning.
Therefore, we have proposed the use of an intelligent model of personalized learning management in a virtual simulation environment based on instances of learning objects, using a similarity function through the weighted multidimensional Euclidean distance.
The results obtained by the proposed model show an efficiency of 99.5%; which is superior to other models such as Simple Logistic with 98.99% efficiency, Naive Bayes with 97.98% efficiency, Tree J48 with 96.98% efficiency, and Neural Networks with 94.97% efficiency.
For which we have designed and implemented the experimental platform MIGAP (Intelligent Model of Personalized Learning Management), which focuses on the assembly of mastery courses in Newtonian Mechanics.
Additionally, the application of this model in other areas of knowledge will allow better identification of the best learning style of each student; with the objective of providing resources, activities and educational services that are flexible to the learning style of each student, improving the quality of current educational services.},

  title={YouTube Assessment as a Means of Documentary Research Students},

  abstract={The research determines to what extent YouTube can be used as a research tool. To carry out the analysis, the design proposed by [1] in the "Journal of Child Neurology" was followed. The importance of this research lies in determining to what extent YouTube can be reliable to be used as a documentary research resource for students in the teaching-learning processes. To this end, thirty videos are selected on three different topics, which are analysed for their effectiveness in terms of technical concepts and for their reliability with respect to the information, they need; two videos, the highest and lowest score, are selected for an experimental group, comparing and contrasting results with a control group. The analysis shows that the videos with the highest scores obtained better grades. It can also be determined that YouTube can be used as a tool for documentary research, however, the correct search, selection and reliability practices are still the key to making the most of this platform. A rubric is also proposed to evaluate videos for using documentary research.},
