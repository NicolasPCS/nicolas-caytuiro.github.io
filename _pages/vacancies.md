We welcome students interested in conducting research at the intersection of `shape analysis`, `3D computer vision`, and `geometry processing`. Our lab offers opportunities for **Ph.D. and Master’s thesis projects**, as well as **undergraduate thesis**, focused on topics such as generative models for 3D data, symmetry-aware learning, and geometric representations for AI.

If you're motivated by challenges in 3D modeling, machine learning, computer vision, and want to work on cutting-edge problems with real-world applications, we encourage you to reach out. For inquiries, please contact **Prof. Iván Sipiran** at [isipiran@dcc.uchile.cl](mailto:isipiran@dcc.uchile.cl).
