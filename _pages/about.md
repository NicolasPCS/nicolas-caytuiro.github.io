I am developing a symmetry-aware framework for 3D generative models.

**Current focus:** 3D generative models and geometry processing.

I am a second-year Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chile, advised by [Ivan Sipiran](https://www.ivan-sipiran.com/) (He is super nice!). My research focuses on `deep learning` and `3D computer vision`, particularly generative models and their applications. Currently, I am working on preserving structural priors in `3D generative models`, specifically `symmetry`. 

I am the co-founder of the [Shape Vision Lab](https://shapevision.dcc.uchile.cl/) at the University of Chile and an affiliated PhD student at the [National Center for Artificial Intelligence CENIA](https://cenia.cl/), Santiago, Chile.
