# Discovery and analysis of teaching behavior in the university teaching process through the use of process mining techniques.

Normally it is assumed that the improvement of the teaching-learning process lies in the insertion of new techniques, methods, or technology in the process; but the human factor is left aside, mainly the teacher, perhaps assuming that he/she is properly trained. We want to investigate the relationship between the activities carried out by the teacher and the level of learning achieved, but we want to do it automatically, therefore, as a first step, it is necessary to identify what the teacher does and how it is related to the level of learning. In this paper, we applied Process Mining techniques to discover (model) and analyze the teaching-learning process in higher education automatically, and the results show that it is possible.
