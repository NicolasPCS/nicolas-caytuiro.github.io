# Symmetry-conditioned Generation of 3D Point Clouds

This project aims to investigate how the geometric structure of 3D objects—such as symmetry—can be incorporated into the design of generative models. Unlike current approaches that merely replicate data distributions, we propose using these structures as priors to enhance both the realism and generalization capabilities of the models.
